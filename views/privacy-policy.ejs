        <p>Thank you for visiting our website. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to safeguarding your personal data.

        <ul>

        <p>We do not collect your <span class="highlight">email address</span>, <span class="highlight">password</span>, or any other sensitive personal information related to your Discord account.</p>

        <h2>Staff Applications</h2>
        <p>When applying for a staff role on our platform, we collect the details you submit through the application form. Your application will be stored in our database for record-keeping purposes, even after a decision (whether approval or rejection) is made.</p>

        <h2>Request for Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>If you wish to delete your personal information from our database, please contact us by opening a support ticket on our <a href="https://discord.gg/g53ZHxTVgM" target="_blank">Discord server</a>. We will process your request promptly and remove your data as per your request.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>

            <li>To store your username, user ID, and the servers you belong to for relevant site features.</li>
            <li>To maintain records of your staff application status (approved, denied, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We prioritize your privacy and take robust measures to ensure your data is secure. While we employ industry-standard security protocols, it's important to note that no electronic system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
